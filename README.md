## Introduction

Ensuring public safety is a challenging task requiring excellent time management, resource allocation, and adequate planning. Given the history of criminal activity in Chicago, this task is even more difficult. The goal of this project is to empower public safety through advanced analytics, providing insights tailored to the needs of the Chicago Police Department (CPD).

## Research Problem

The analysis focuses on two main principles:
1. Crime occurrence over time and the most common types of crimes and their locations.
2. Effectiveness of law enforcement by measuring the ratio of arrests by districts and beats.

The research questions addressed in this project are:
1. How has the number of crimes changed over the years and months? Which types of crimes are most common, and how have they changed from 2017 to 2021?
2. Which districts had the highest number of crimes? What is the arrest ratio in different beats and districts?
3. How does the number of crimes change over the day? In which types of locations do they most often occur?

## Data Description

The data set consists of over 730,000 crime records from the Chicago Police Department, covering various areas of interest such as crime trends over time, geographic location, police units, and types of locations.
